    """

    Inputs:
        contest        - the contest being audited (Contest structure)

        cvrs           - mapping of ballot_id to votes:
                {
                    'ballot_id': {
                        'contest': {
                            'candidate1': 1,

                        }
                    ...
                }

        winner         - reported winner of the contest

        asn_func       - function that takes an assertion assorter margin
                         and returns an estimate of how difficult a RAIRE 
                         assertion with that margin will be to audit.

        log            - flag indicating if logging statements should
                         be printed during the algorithm.

        stream         - stream to which logging statements should
                         be printed.
        
        agap           - allowed gap between the lower and upper bound
                         on expected audit difficulty. Once these bounds
                         converge (to within 'agap') algorithm can stop
                         and return  audit configuration found. Generally,
                         keep this at 0 unless the algorithm is not 
                         terminating in a reasonable time. Then set it to
                         as small a value as possible, and increase, until
                         the algorithm terminates. For some instances, the
                         difference between the lower and upper bound on 
                         expected audit difficulty gets to a point where it
                         is quite small, but doesn't converge. 

    Outputs:
        A list of RaireAssertions to be audited. If this collection of
        assertions is found to hold, then all alternate outcomes, in which
        an alternate candidate to 'winner' wins, can be ruled out.
